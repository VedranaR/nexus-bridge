## Open a Pull Request 

If you would like to contribute, please start by searching through the [issues](/issues) and [pull requests](/pulls) to find out if somebody else has already implemented or requested the change. If you did not find your change listed, and you think it fits into the goals of the Nexus Bridge, do one of the following:
   * If your contribution is minor, such as a bug fixing, open a pull request.
   * If your contribution is major, such as a new feature adding, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
